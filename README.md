 Progressively developed a comprehensive server-client system, starting with foundational user request proto-
cols and encryption/decryption mechanisms. The system evolved into a concurrent key-value store supporting
operations such as insertion, deletion, and updates. Incremental persistence was integrated to enhance crash
recovery, followed by advanced resource management features, including quotas and MRU (Most Recently Used)
tracking, to mitigate abuse. Ultimately, a virtual execution environment was implemented to expand functionality
and support complex use cases.
